wave-gadgets
============

These are various wave gadgets I have decided to open-source.  You may use the code as a reference, but please _do not_ blatantly copy chunks of my code without my permission.

This is _not_ the repo for the [Wave Extensions Gallery](https://github.com/zmyaro/wave-extensions-gallery).
